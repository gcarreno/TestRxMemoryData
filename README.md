# Test RxMemoryData

An application to demonstrate how to use `TRxMemoryData`.

This particular component does not have a feature to sort the data.

It does, however, have a feature to filter the data.

Also using the `TRxDBGrid` for the visualization of the data, since I'm already using the RX package.
